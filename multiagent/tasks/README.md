# Tasks

In a target repository, create one task file per active GitHub Issue or repo-local task.

In this protocol-template repository, do not create live `GH-*` or `TASK-*` files. Keep this directory limited to reusable guidance and template references.

Use `multiagent/templates/task-template.md` as the starting point.

## Naming

GitHub issue tasks:

```text
GH-123-short-title.md
```

Repo-only tasks:

```text
TASK-000-short-title.md
```

## Required Practice

- Do not start implementation until the task is `ready`.
- Mark unclear tasks as `blocked` or keep them out of `ready` until questions are answered.
- Split large repo-local tasks into smaller task files when they contain separable work.
- Keep status and branch current.
- Record discoveries while working.
- List changed files before review.
- Record commands and results.
- Link the PR when code changes.
- Add handoff notes if incomplete or risky.
